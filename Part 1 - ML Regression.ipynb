    "As my friend and I prepared for our Fantacalcio 21/22 season, I wondered if I could do any further analysis using the python libraries I am familiar with. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar, Fantacalcio is the name of the Italian Serie A Draft Fantasy football competition. Our league consists of 8 to 10 people usually but calcio lovers all over Italy have their own private leagues and it's a very popular game. Essentially it is a head to head draft league, but you bid for players you want in an auction format, with all the other competitors present. You each have 1000 credits to fill a 23 man squad, of which 11 players can play at a time, so you want to fill these positions the best you can, to optimize your points. After the auction is done, there is a match for each gameweek of the season, where you face one of your rivals head to head, and whoever takes the most points from their designated 11 players that week (who get points for scoring, asssiting, clean sheet etc.) win 3 points and potentially move up the table. Most points at the end of the season is the winner.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is fairly simple (perhaps my explanation is not the best so do Google if necessary) but as you can imagine, there are a lot of moving parts so there is an oppurtunity for analysis. Of course, you want to use your budget in the wisest way in order to maximize your potenital points. Initially I had the idea use ML techniques to perform a regression, predicting player prices so we could scalp undervalued players, as well as avoiding overpaying for any players.\n",

Most importantly their name which will be the unique identifier, their position and their fantacalcio scores of the last 2 years. We are looking at 149 players that we have sufficient data for, and omit goalkeepers for now as their scoring system is completely different from outfield players and does not tie in the regression techniques in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few lines used to get the dataset \"calcio.csv\" into a format from which we can begin to work from. Some work has already been done to the raw csv file in Excel in order to prepare it without using any code. Namely I removed some rows that had insuffiecient information and might affect the regression negatively. Also, an average value was taken using 1/3 of the 19/20 Score and 2/3 of the 20/21 Score. We welcome this recency bias as it places more emphasis on the more recent form of the players.\n",

    "We choose to scale the bid data, as it can vary by a magnitude of more than 10. We define the scaler using the MinMaxScaler function and create a new column representing these scaled bid values.\n",

    "Sorting by the predicted 21/22 value, we can immediately see where the issues lie. The highest value players have residuals of over 100 associated with them. Some positive and some negative. There is an argument for excluding some of these outliers but there are perhaps too many to be excluded. Plus it could be said that these are the players we are most interested in as they are where large portions of our budget will go. Excluding them would prove the study somewhat futile.\n",

By this point I became more concerned with a different area that I was interested in; optimizing the transfer budget by finding how much to spend in each position, as oppose to looking at individual players.\n",
